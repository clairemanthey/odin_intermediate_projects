## Introduction
Welcome to my projects and solutions to the exercises from The Odin Project’s [Intermediate HTML and CSS Intermediate course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/intermediate-html-and-css). The course builds on the basics of HTML and CSS from their foundations course. It includes concepts such as CSS units, advanced selectors, positioning, forms, form validation, grid and flexbox.

This course included 2 exercises and 2 projects using concepts both from the foundations course and Intermediate HTML and CSS course. The exercises were to complete the [MDN tables assessment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Structuring_planet_data) and the grid exercises from their [CSS exercises](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/css-exercises). The projects were to create a form web application, and an admin dashboard. For both projects the curriculum provides a design file as a general guide. The sign up form project was to create a form complete with validation for inputs and password march. The admin dashboard was a project in using grid to build a full dashboard design. 

## Motivation
I began The Odin Projects intermediate course to review and practice my HTML and CSS skills. To see if there were any concepts I had missed and practice ones I already knew and fill in any gaps in knowledge. I was also interested in gaining more experience in using HTML and CSS. Also completing projects using those HTML and CSS concepts to see what they can do when building a web application.
